# CIA Model
The CIA model stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It is a foundational concept in information security that outlines three core principles to ensure the security of information and systems. 
- Confidentiality: ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals or entities. (Data is accessed by authorized entities).
- Integrity: ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. It involves protecting data from unauthorized modification, deletion, or alteration, whether intentional or accidental. (Data haven't been tampered with).
- Availability: ensures that information and resources are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users.
#### Authenticity: 
Authenticity refers to the assurance that information or communication originates from a trusted source and has not been tampered with or altered during transmission. It ensures that the sender of the information is who they claim to be, and the receiver can verify the source's identity.
#### Non-repudiation: 
Non-repudiation ensures that a sender cannot deny the authenticity or integrity of a message or transaction they have sent. It provides proof of the origin and integrity of the communication, preventing the sender from later denying their involvement.
