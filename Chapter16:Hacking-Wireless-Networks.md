# Wireless Basics

## Wireless Features
1. **Access Points (APs):**
   - Devices that provide wireless connectivity.
2. **Wireless LAN (WLAN):**
   - Local Area Network using wireless connections.
3. **BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier):**
   - MAC address of the access point.
4. **SSID (Service Set Identifier):**
   - Name of the wireless network.
5. **Association:**
   - Connecting to an AP. Disassociation needed to connect to a different AP.

## Wireless Standards (802.11)
1. **802.11a:**
   - Frequency: 5 GHz
   - Distance: 35-100 meters
   - Speed: 54 Mbps
2. **802.11b:**
   - Frequency: 2.4 GHz
   - Distance: 35-140 meters
   - Speed: 11 Mbps
3. **802.11g:**
   - Frequency: 2.4 GHz
   - Distance: 38-140 meters
   - Speed: 54 Mbps
4. **802.11n:**

   - Frequency: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz
   - Distance: Up to 9.1 meters
   - Speed: 574-9,608 Mbps

## Authentication Types
1. **Open WiFi:**
   - No authentication required.
2. **Pre-Shared Key (PSK):**
   - Common password-based authentication.
3. **Centralized Authentication (e.g., RADIUS):**
   - Used in corporate environments.

## Types of Antennas
1. **Yagi Antennas:**
   - Directional, common for TV antennas.
2. **Omnidirectional Antennas:**
   - Radiates signal in all directions.
3. **Parabolic Grid Antennas:**
   - Used for long-distance, looks like a grid.
4. **Reflectors:**
   - Enhance signal by concentrating EM radiation.

## Wireless Encryption Types
1. **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):**
   - 24-bit IV, RC4 algorithm, weak security.
2. **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):**
   - 48-bit IV, RC4 with TKIP, improved but still vulnerable.
3. **WPA2:**
   - 48-bit IV, AES CCMP, 128-bit encryption, secure but crackable.
4. **WPA3:**
   - AES-GCMP-256, 192-bit encryption, personal and enterprise modes, currently robust.
